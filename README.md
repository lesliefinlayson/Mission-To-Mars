# Mission-To-Mars
## Mission Failure due to Dependency Issues and Environmental Issues

Unable to complete project due to issues.  Spent 2+ hours with TA on Saturday and unable to resolove.  Will ask for further assistance.  Problems are:

1.  Error message when running Mission-To-Mars.ipynb.  Chromedriver not found.  
      Tried numerous ways to correct this - Splinter is installed, tried installing Python3 and then Firefox (at TA's suggestion)
2.  Error message when running Flask that there is no module flask-pymongo.  Also installed.
